If you keep talking like that, you’re gonna catch these hands.
She dragged him for his terrible performance.
This pizza is bussin’!
Her makeup was snatched at the event.
People are saying he’s canceled after those comments.
FFS, why is this meeting taking so long?
He’s such an e-boy with those black nails and chains.
She’s such an e-girl with her neon eyeliner and platform boots.
She wore the same dress as the bride at the wedding? Big yikes.

That car is clapped, it’s falling apart.
I waited all day for him to text me back. I’m such a clown.
That old tweet was so cringy, I can’t believe I posted that.
I have major FOMO after seeing everyone’s vacation pics.
You’re moving to LA? Fr?
Ion even care what they think.
This meme is too much, I can’t even!
Let’s meet IRL next week.

Yas queen! You’re slaying that outfit!
He yeeted the ball across the yard.
He talks with his mouth full, that gave me the ick.

I’m spending the weekend with my bae.
How’s it going? SSDD.
The beach is amazing, WYWH!
I think he’s benching me—he texts but never makes plans.
She’s breadcrumbing him, always texting but never wanting to meet.
Everyone’s cuffing this fall, it’s relationship season.
We need to DTR soon, I need to know where we stand.
He keeps telling me I’m overreacting, but I think he’s gaslighting me.
Goodnight, ILY!
She’s always late—kind of a pink flag, but not a dealbreaker.
They hooked up last night, definitely a smash.
We’ve been hanging out a lot, but it’s just a situationship.
Look at him in that suit, total zaddy vibes.

You keep saying that, but DYNWUTB?
You were looking for your keys, DYFI?
The way you explain things, DYFM!
DYJHIW you lose your keys right when you need them?
Before you invest, make sure to DYOR.
She was at the club on E last night.
Watch out, E approaching from the left!
E1 needs to be ready by 5 PM.
Don’t worry about it, it’s E123!
After hearing the good news, I had an E2EG.
I’ll reply in a bit, I’m EAK right now.
It’s not a tech issue, just an EBKAC!
I accidentally hit ED and lost my work.
That took a lot of EF4T to complete.
He gave me an EG after pulling that prank.
I told him he’d fail, and he totally had to EI.
The blog post is still EIP, I’ll send it when it’s ready.
Can you ELI5 how blockchain works?
I’ll send you the details via EM.
What’s your EMA so I can send the files?
That mistake was so EMBAR!
EMFBI, but I think you’re mistaken about that.
EMFBI, can I add something here?
I sent you an EMSG this morning.
That’s ENUF, let’s move on.
Please submit the report by EOD.
We’ve already decided, EOD.
That’s all for today, EOL.
This software is nearing its EOL.
Meeting moved to 3 PM, EOM.
We’ll talk after EOS.
I’ve sent all the data, EOT.
I used to play EQ all the time.
He’s into ERP in online games.
ERS2? I can’t believe that happened!
I accidentally hit ES and lost all my work.
I was so mad, I told him to ESAD.
What’s your ETA? The meeting starts soon.
ETA: I just found the missing files.
That was the best movie EVA!
The EVO of technology is fascinating.
He was EWG me about my new haircut.
I sent an embarrassing email last night, totally EWI.
Her outfit was so EXTRA, but I loved it!
She handled the news EYC, excited but not overwhelmed.
That task was EZ, no problem!
The instructions were super EZY to follow.
The gamer I met was an F.
Let’s meet F2F to discuss the details.
That new game is F2P, so everyone can try it.
I’ll F4F if you’re interested!
I’ve been working for hours and I’m FAAK right now.
You look absolutely FAB tonight!
I forgot my wallet at home, facepalm.
That video was FAF!
What’s up, FAM? Let’s hang out this weekend.
Check out the FAQ before you ask any questions.
I’m done with this nonsense, FAY!
Add me on FB!
She’s my FBB, we met through a group.
I’ll FBC you later about the event.
Here’s a pic from my trip last year, #FBF.
We’re FBFs, but we haven’t met in person.
Pizza and wings, time for some FBF!
He’s just an FBFR, we don’t talk much.
If you want to skip the movie, FBM.
We’re finally FBO—changed our relationship status!
We’re in this together, FBOW.
FC that I get the job!
I’ve got an FC today, can’t take any more meetings.
FC’INGO, just tell me the answer already!
FCOL, why is this taking so long?
Lost the game, feelsbadman.
Got rejected for the third time, feelsbatman.
Just finished my project early, feelsgoodman.
If they didn’t like my joke, FEITCTAJ.
Shoutout to my favorite accounts for #FF!
It’s an FFA in the chat, anything goes!
FFS, can we please get this done?
You can complain all you want, FICCL.
Just made the best joke, FIF!
How does this work? FIIK!
This meeting is going nowhere, FIIOOH.
My FIL is visiting this weekend.
You’ll always be FIMH, no matter what.
I’m finna grab some food, you want anything?
She posted it on her finsta, not her main account.
Been working all day, FISH.
The answer is easy, just FITB.
Spilled coffee all over my laptop, FML.
That joke had me FOMC!
I have such FOMO, everyone’s going to that concert except me.
He really made me mad, I just wanted to tell him FOAD.
I heard about the party from a FOAF.
That prank had me FOMCL!
That test was tough, FRT.
Thank you, FTBOMH, for everything you’ve done.
You said the movie was bad, but I FTFY—it’s great!
We missed the bus, FTL!
Got the last slice of pizza, FTW!
You messed up my plans, FU!
That project is completely FUBAR now.
This project is completely FUBB.
Let’s FUD and see who wins.
I’m exhausted, time to FUTAB.
I’ll FW you the email.
They’re not dating, just FWB.
FWIW, I think your idea is great.
If you want to stay in tonight, FWM.
My phone’s battery died, FWP.
That new song is FYE!
This document is FYEO.
Here’s a funny meme, FYA!
FYI, the meeting is tomorrow at 3 PM.
That joke made me G.
She told a funny story, I had to G.
I added you on G+.
My G/F is meeting me after work.
It’s been so long, G2CU!
I’m late for my meeting, G2G.
Can’t stay long, G2GICYAL8ER!
Sorry, G2R! I’ll text you later.
G2TU, I passed the exam!
I’m G4C, want to join?
That idea is G9!
If you’re ready, GA with the presentation.
You’re completely wrong, GAC.
Before you criticize, GAFC!
All you do is play video games, GAL!
I got ganked while questing.
Hey, GAS? I need some help.
GAS, how’s everyone doing today?
I’ve got to head out, GB!
Break’s over, time to GBTW.
Thanks for your help, GBU.
That meal was really GD!
Just teasing, GDR!
That was a bold statement, GD/R!
If you think it’s a good idea, GFI!
I’m going out with my GF tonight.

How’s it going, GG?
Thanks for playing, GGA!
That was fun, GGE1!
GGU2, that was close!
That dessert looks amazing, GGMSOT!
This party is getting boring, GGOH.
BRB, GGP!
That was a GH, I thought I had you beat.
You’ve been complaining all day, GIAR!
I left a GIC for the baby shower.
If the data is wrong, the results will be too—GIGO.
That character looks like a girl, but he’s actually a GIRL.
You completed the task, GJ!
GL on your test tomorrow!
GL2U in the competition!
GLA in the tournament, everyone!

She’s a GRL I met online.
You need to GRWG after that mistake.
I know you’re mad, but GR&D!
Nice play, GS!
That was a GS during the game!
We didn’t win, but GT!
That’s ridiculous, GTFO!
You really believe that? GTFOH!
I’m late for my meeting, GTG.
That comment had me GTM.
Be right back, GTRM.
It’s been a while, GTSY!
Everything’s GUCCI here.
That meal was GUD!

I need to heal, my HP is low.
Hey, HRU? Haven’t heard from you in a while.
Here’s the link to the article, HTH!
He has no clue what he’s doing, his HUB is so far up!
Stop messing around, get your HUYA and focus!
I’ll HV it done by tomorrow.
We’re running HVH tonight, want to join?

IAE, we should still be prepared.
Trust me, IANAC!
I don’t know the law on this, IANAL.
This discussion is going nowhere, IAO.
Missed anything while I was gone? IB!
I had to step out, but IB now.
Oh, IC what you mean now.
That’s exactly how I feel, ICAM!
It’s not great, but ICBW.
The meeting was a disaster, ICEDI.
You’re amazing, ICFILWU!
ICYMI, the new season starts next week.
You won the lottery? IDBI!

ILU, see you soon!
Thanks for everything, ILUM!
ILYSM, you’re the best!
Goodnight, ILY!
Just IM me when you’re ready.
IMAO, that movie was overrated.

I got your message, ImL!
IMNSHO, we should have left earlier.
IMO, it’s best to start early.
IMS, I didn’t mean to offend you.
There’s nothing to do, IMSB.
I finished all my tasks early, IMTM!
Haven’t seen you in a while, IMU.
INAL, but I think you should get legal advice.
Heads up, INC message!
Looking at art galleries for some inspoo.
Send me an INV to the game.
I took on too many projects, IOMH.
IOW, we need to work faster.
We should meet up IRL sometime.
That’s exactly what I was saying, IRMC!
We had a fight, but ISLY.
ISO a new job, any leads?
Why is this so complicated? ITAM!
ITT: People share their favorite books.
ITYK that the meeting was rescheduled.
I’m not sure, but IUSS.
No matter what happens, IWALU.
This job is too stressful, IWAWO.
That decision was ridiculous, he’s an IWIAM.
She texted me, IWSN!
That conversation got a little awkward, IYKWIM.	
IYO, what’s the best way to learn coding?

You went to the concert? I’m so JELLY!
I took the quiz JFF, it’s not serious.
I don’t know the answer, JFGI!
Take an umbrella, JIC it rains.
I didn’t mean it, JJ!
Don’t take it seriously, I’m JJA.
I’m moving to Mars… JK!
If you’re free tomorrow, JLMK.
JMO, but I think the first movie was better.
I wasn’t being serious, JP!
We hit the JP with that business deal!
Don’t get mad, I’m JT!
JTLYK, the meeting’s been moved to 3 PM.
We’re starting a JV with another company.

I’ll see you later, K?

KK, I’ll meet you at the restaurant.
K8T is coming to the party tonight.
I need a new k/b, mine is broken.
My KB stopped working.
Go out there and KB in your presentation!
That joke had me KDFU!
That new game is KEWL!
I’m busy now, but KEYA when I’m free.
KEYME once you arrive at the hotel.
Goodnight! KFY!
He’s such a KIA, always correcting people.
No matter what happens, just KIR.
Remember the KISS principle while writing the report.
It was great seeing you, KIT!
If they don’t like it, they can KMA.
Don’t like my opinion? KMK!
I have so much homework, KMS.
You don’t agree? Well, KMT.
I gave her a KOC when we said goodbye.
He’s a KOL in the tech industry.
She’s a total Koreaboo, always watching K-dramas.
KOS right now, I’ll text you later.
That enemy guild is KOS in this area.
I haven’t been sick all year, KOW!
We said goodbye with a KOTC.

His coding skills are so l33t.
Follow me for a L4L!
I’ll catch you L8R!
Gotta run, L8RG8R!
This week has been so stressful, LAB.
That was a good one, LBAY!
You need to stop doing that, LBS.
I’m laughing, but LBVS, you need to fix that.
It’s been fun, LD!
We’ve been in an LD relationship for a year.
We’re going to the concert, LDO!
LEMENO if you’re free this weekend.

This project is driving me crazy, LHM.
That story had me LHO!
I just updated my LI profile.
You don’t like my opinion? LIC!
We need some LIK for the party.

That meme had me LLS!
Your story is hilarious, LMAO!
I couldn’t stop laughing, LMBO!
That prank had me LMFAO!
We’ve been chatting for weeks, LMIRL sometime?
LMK if you need help with your project.
That joke had me LMMFAO!
I don’t want to get involved, so LMNK.
LMS if you’re ready for the weekend!
That joke didn’t make sense, it was LNT.
Here’s an LOA for the project terms.
That cat video made me LOL!
The movie was so funny, I couldn’t stop LOL.
Miss you, LOL!
That meme has me LOLH!
Sending you LOLO from across the miles.
That situation was so bizarre, I’m LOLWTF!
That was mildly funny, but I’m just LOTI.
I just rewatched LOTR last weekend.
That was pretty funny, I’m LQTM over here.
That stand-up comedian had me LSHMBH!
This movie is rated for LSV.
I just got a promotion, LTD!
Can’t wait for the party, LTLWDLS!
Wow, LTNS! How have you been?
My old laptop keeps crashing, it’s an LTOD!
I read your message and started LTS.
Thanks for always being there, LULT!
I joined the prank for the LULZ.
I LVM, call me back when you can.
That was so dry, I’m LWOS over here.
Goodnight, LY!
You’re the best, LYLAS!
You’re amazing, LYLC!
I miss you, LYSM!
I just installed the latest update from M$.
How’s it going, M8?
He’s always calling his mom for advice, such an MB.
I can’t talk about that right now, MBS.
Wishing you all a MC and a Happy New Year!
MDIAC, so I know a lot about law enforcement.
Whenever they talk about quantum physics, MEGO.
That movie was MEH, nothing special.

I’m with MISS.3, we’re going to the park.
That’s your plan? MKAY, sounds good.
He was being so rude, so I gave him the MLM.
Hanging out with my MM this weekend.
You’re coming over later? MMK?
Sorry, MNC—I’ll be right back.
I just received an MNSG, can you help translate?
The MOD had to step in and calm things down.
I downloaded a new MOD for the game.
You didn’t mention—MORF?
He’s such a MOMBOY, always calling his mom for advice.
In MOO, that’s not the best approach.
Are you bringing a MOOS to the party?
Can’t talk about that right now, MOS.
We’ve got a MOSS joining our team.
I’m out of MP, need to recharge.
Spending the afternoon with MR.3 at the park.
I made an MRT of that tweet with my own comment.
MRW I found out the concert was canceled.
I’ll send you an MSG later with the details.
I’ll send the first draft now, MTF on updates.
Good luck on your test! MTFBWU!
It’s been so long since we hung out, MU!
I tried making a joke but it was MUAH.
Haven’t seen you in ages, MUSM!
Goodnight, MWAH!
That’s personal, MYO!

Don’t worry, everyone’s a n00b at first.
You really aced that presentation, N1!
What’s up with you? N2M over here.

NGL, that was the best meal I’ve had in a while.
I’m addicted to playing NFS.
That car is NFS, sorry!
You got tickets to the concert? NFW!
That meme is NFW, don’t open it here!
Be careful with that link, it’s NFWS.
You played that perfectly, NH!
I’m home alone, NIFOC right now.
Oh, I misunderstood earlier, NIGI now.
They’re proposing a new building, but it’s a total NIMBY situation.
BRB, NIROK for a few minutes.
Please send the report NLT Friday.
What’s up? NM, just hanging out.
Wait, NM, I found the answer.
You played that card well, NM!
How’s it going? NMH, just relaxing.
What are you up to tonight? NMJC.

Thanks for your help! NP!
That NPC just gave me a quest.
She’s doing great as an NQT!
You got double sixes, NR!
I just wanted to update you—NRN.
You got 100 points, NS!
That bowling split was tough, but NS!
I’m not looking for anything serious, just NSA.
That video is NSFL, don’t watch it!
That image is NSFW, don’t open it at the office!
I think it’s ‘accommodate,’ NSISR.
You didn’t win, but NT!
What’s up? NTHING, just relaxing.
NTS: Remember to send the email tomorrow.
Forget what I said, NVM.
I’d NVR do that!
You won the lottery? NW!
This situation feels like there’s NWO.
I saved the last slice O4U!
We’re facing a tough O in the next round.
Sending you O, hope you feel better soon!
Mission complete, O.
I got a great deal through OA.
OATUS, did you see the game last night?
That was an amazing shot, OB!
You lost your keys again? OB!
OBV, I was going to say yes!
OFC I’ll be there tomorrow.
He’s the OG of street style.
The weekend went by so fast, OGIM.

You’re really mad? OJ!
Going to visit my OL this weekend.

Posting my OOTD for Instagram.
I’m OOTO until Monday, so I’ll reply then.
Can’t talk right now, I’m OP.
You finished the project already? ORLY?
I’m updating my OS tonight.
This might be OT, but did you see the game last night?
It’s late, OTB for me.
That joke had me OTFL!
I’m OTL, back in an hour.
It’s expensive, but OTOH, it’s a great investment.
Can’t talk, I’m OTP right now.
They’re my favorite OTP from the show.
That party was so OTT, but fun!
OTTOMH, I’d say it’s about five miles.
Got to go, OTW now!
That match is OVA!
I can’t make it, you’re OYO this time.
I’m going to dinner with my P tonight.
It’s nice to have a P2P discussion about school events.
P2P sharing is common in online networks.
This game is P2P, so you need a subscription.
Can’t talk now, P911!
PAP of your new car!
We’re on PAT duty tonight.
Can’t discuss that right now, PAW.
I found your number in the PBOOK.
My PC is a wizard in the game.
If you’re free later, PCM.
They were showing too much PDA at the park.
Got the job! I’m PDH right now!
I’m unarmed, PDS!
I’ll be there PDQ!
Hanging out with my PEEPS this weekend.
Your new car is PFT!
Send me a PIC of your new puppy!
That joke had me PIP!
PIR, can’t talk about that right now.
Can you PISS in my coffee?
This project is such a PITA.
I caught a rare PKMN today!
I just got a new PL8 for my car.
That was a well-PLD match!
PLMK if you’re free tomorrow.
Can you send me the report, PLS?
This event is perfect for PLU!
PLZ send me the details ASAP.
PLZTLME what happened at the meeting!
I’ll PM you the details.
PMFI, but I think we need to revise this.
PMFJI, but I have a suggestion.
That story had me PMSL!
You’re having a tough day? POAHF!
If there’s no photo, POIDH!
POS, talk later.
I need to use a POT to heal.
Check out my POTD on Instagram!
From my POV, this makes the most sense.
I’ll be taking my POV on the road trip.
A lot of PPL showed up to the event.
The package is PPU.
Your baby is so PRESH!
I’ll PROBS be there by 7.
I’ll PROLLY skip the meeting.
I’m running a new PROGGY on my laptop.
Be careful, that site’s full of PRON.
Are you coming to the PRT tonight?
Help spread the word, PRT!
Can’t talk about it now, PRW.
Just a PSA: Don’t forget to hydrate!
Let’s change the topic, PSOS.
I’ve been playing on my PSP all day.
Looking for a group, PST.
I was so exhausted, I just PTFO last night.
Well, we won the game, PTIYPASI!
PTL, we made it home safely!
That sounds interesting, PTMM!
I’m using some PTO to take a vacation.
I’ll be taking some PTO next week.
We’re having a PTO meeting at the school.
I joined a PUG for the dungeon.
I prefer PVE content over PVP.
Let’s try some PVP battles tonight!
I totally PWNed that game last night!
I didn’t understand your point, PXT.
What’s that smell? PU!
I’ll be late, need to PUKS.
She’s such a PYT!
Got to go, PZ!
Let’s order some PZA for dinner.
I’ve been waiting in the Q for 30 minutes.
Hey, Q4U—what’s the plan for tonight?
We need to run a QC check on the product.
QFE: What’s everyone’s favorite movie?
That statement is ridiculous, QFI!
They said they’d never change their mind… QFI.
What they said was spot on, QFT.
Let’s grab a QIK coffee before the meeting.
Come on, QL! I’m being serious.
‘Be yourself; everyone else is already taken’—QOTD.
I lost my keys, Q_Q.
Hey, QQ: What time does the event start?
I sent the message, still waiting for a QSL.
I had a great QSO with him about technology.
Look at that dog, such a QT!
My niece is an absolute QTPI!
R you coming to the party tonight?
R8 my outfit from 1 to 10!
You’re awesome! RBAY!
We need to leave RFN!
RGR, I’ll meet you there.
I got the best seat—RHIP!
RIP, we’ll miss you.
I can’t play tonight, got RL stuff to do.
RLY? That’s amazing!
He’s late again, RME.
RMLB, I’m not going to change my mind.
You need more details? RMMM!
That joke had me ROFL!
That video was so funny, ROFLCOPTER!
I couldn’t stop laughing, ROFLMAO!
That meme had me ROTFL!
The prank was so good, ROTFLUTS!
I’ve been playing RS all weekend.
I’ll finish the report RSN.
I’ll be there at 5, RT.
Thanks for the RT!
After that drama, I’ve got a new RTBS.
You’re doing it wrong, RTFM!
You missed the point, RTFQ!
RTHX for sharing my post!
Before you ask, RTMS!
We need to focus on customer RTNTN.
The pay raise will be RTRCTV to last month.
She’s planning for RTRMT in a few years.
You’re still confused? RTSM!
You missed the point, RTWFQ!
RU coming to the party tonight?
Before we start the game, RUMOF?
I’ve been texting you, RUT?
You seem upset, RUOK?
I’ll see you soon, RX.
Got to get back to RW responsibilities.
I need to pick up my RX from the pharmacy.
Feeling down? RYB for inspiration.
I prefer RYO cigarettes.
The instructions are clear, RYS!
We’ve been chatting for a while, RYS?
S2R your address, and I’ll mail it.
S2S, but the event has been canceled.
If you sign up for that site, you’ll get S4L.
That story was SAL!
I didn’t mean to be late, SAT!
His comment was SAVAGE, but true.
I’ll SB when I get your message.
The project SB done by Friday.
You sent me a picture of your smile, SB!
That performance had me SBIA!
I didn’t mean to miss the call, SBT.
It’s getting hot out, SC!
Goodnight, SD!
Tucking you in, SDMB.
SENPAI noticed me!
We need to improve our SEO for better website traffic.
When I saw the surprise, I was SETE!
Just took a SELFIE at the beach!
SFAIK, the meeting is still on for tomorrow.
You’re tired? SH, I’m exhausted too.
That’s so funny, SH^!
I forgot my keys again, SHID!
I totally SHIP those two characters!
I had to make the joke, SICNR.
I’m late, SIG2R!
After that decision, SIHTH.
SIMYC, I was in a meeting.
One day, I’ll SIR with this idea!
That joke was so bad, I’m SIS.
I’m spending the weekend with my SIS.
It was great catching up, SIT!
I’m SITD about the details of the project.
She’s always advocating for causes, total SJW.
We’re going to SK8 at the park later.
I’ve been SK8NG since I was a kid.
He’s a total SK8R with all the tricks.
I used to have a crush on a SK8RBOI.
Let’s meet at 7 for dinner? SLAP!
You totally slayed that presentation!
I spend way too much time on SM.
The sky was SMAZED after the fireworks.
He’s SMEXI, isn’t he?
He forgot his homework again, SMH.
The logic in that statement has me SMHID.
The meeting turned into a SNAFU.
That SNERT really needs to learn some manners.
I’ve got so many SNRs to reply to on Snapchat.
I’m going out with my SO tonight.
That SOAB cut me off in traffic!
Don’t worry about being late, S’OK.
SOL, you’ll get used to it.
I’ve texted you three times today, SOMY?
Just wondering, SorG?
SOS, I’m lost in the city!
He was acting like a total SOS.
Can’t chat long, I’m SOT today.
SOTMG, I’ll talk to you later.
Can’t talk now, SOWM.
SPK your mind, I’m listening.
SRSLY, I can’t believe he said that.
Let’s meet SPST next week.
I SPTO her about the event.
He’s so SQ, always following the rules.
SRY I missed your call.
SS for being late!
Nothing new here, SSDD.
That movie was SSIF, I couldn’t stop laughing.
His argument was SSINF, I couldn’t even respond.
You better ST&D before you get into trouble!
I totally Stan for that band!
I couldn’t believe what he was saying, STFU!
I’m STR8, not interested.
If you don’t know, just STW.
SU, I can’t believe you said that!
Goodnight! SUITM.
Heading out now, SUL!
SUP? Haven’t heard from you in a while.
They’re talking again, but I’m SUTH.
That traffic SUX!
That’s not true, SUYF!
I got so much SWAG at the conference!
I don’t know the exact answer, but here’s my SWAG.
I sent you a letter, SWAK.
The letter had SWALK written on the envelope.
I didn’t have time to check the facts, so I made a SWAT.
That joke had me SWL!
SWMBO says I need to mow the lawn.
Got to run, SYL!
I’ll be over in a bit, SYS!
You don’t know what you’re talking about, SYY!

He got TBAGGED after losing in the game.
TBBH, I didn’t like the movie.
The series finale was such a cliffhanger, TBC.
The meeting time is TBD.
TBH, I don’t really like sushi.
I’m busy now, TBL when you can.
Here’s a photo from high school, TBT!
Goodbye, TC!
I’ve got to TCB before the deadline.
Stay safe and TCOY.
I love playing TD games.
He sent me a flirty message saying TD2M.
She jokingly said TDTM during the chat.
Spill the TEA, I want to hear all the details!
